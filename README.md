# Cypress Capstone Project 

It is almost the end of the framework, what is remaining is expanding the test to cover wider scenario for Online Store and prioritizing, execution in suite and groups of the test cases.

Before jumping to the next level, I would like to give an exercise. I would like you to automate end-to-end flow covering below steps:
1)	Register to the http://shop.icraftsoft.net:8095 application.
2)	Login to the application.
3)	Selecting a product category from Top Menu.
4)	Selecting a product and adding it to the cart.
5)	Go to checkout page to provide personal details and complete the order
6)	Verify details from final Confirmation page (Confirm the Order id)

Note: Everything has to been manage from the test data sheet, maximum code reusability, minimum test script writing, and minimum logs insertion, easy to understand.

Remark: The process to set up Cypress Automation Framework with implementing cypress Assertion, Function Parameters, Page Object Model, Dashboard.
